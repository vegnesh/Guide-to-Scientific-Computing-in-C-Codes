1) Default arguments can only be specified once. 
Typically done in function prototype - declaration to allow for users to see stuff in documentation.

2) Every New Statement should have  corresponding delete statement.

3) Naming conventions for pointers - start name with p_x;

4) If you want to access global variable , use ::a for scope resolution


5)  Function Overloading can occur based on number and type of arguements but not based on the return data;

6) Function Pointers. Easiest Example - For use in Newton Rhapson. Can send in the function and its jacobian. 

7) Function pointers must be declared such that they take in the same set of arguments as the function they point to and return the same type of data

8) Document Code Madar

9) Assert - Use assert statements when using pointers

10) Const at end of class functon. That method doesnt change anything in the class

11) Copy constructor always send by reference, in addition, can send copy constructor as constant.

12) Friend Functions must be declared in class definitions. However, they are not member functions of class. 
Friend functions can access private member variables of class

13)q) How does new <class> work with  custom default constructor

14) q) When is copy constructor used? What is copy swap idiom? Algos/headers for copy constructor and operator = 

15) Returing by reference: Can use the value on LHS as well as RHS

16) Q) How exceptions work?
