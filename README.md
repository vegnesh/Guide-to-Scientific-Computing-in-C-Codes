# Guide-to-Scientific-Computing-in-C-Codes

The codes in this repository correspond to the code written based on the exercises given in the Guide to Scientific Computing in C++ text by J.Pitt Francis and J.Whiteley
The code are written in C++. Compilation was done directly from the terminal. 

The codes presented here are mostly my own with some pieces of the code drawn from the text given above. The problem statements for the code are all taken from the text.
